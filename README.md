# ml_to_detect_money_laundering_patterns_in_fintech
The purpose of the study is to develop an ML framework for the early detection of money laundering patterns in financial transactions, which would overcome the limitations of traditional rule-based anti-money laundering (AML) systems.


### Note:

The dataset used in this research is mimicked from the actual dataset of 400 institutional clients and 100 high-net-worth individuals from the Investment Banking and Asset Management sectors of JP Morgan Chase Bank. The synthetic data generated includes:

- Account table dataset
- Party table dataset
- Party supplementary data table
- Risk case event table
- Transaction table dataset

These datasets have been created to provide insights into account ownership, transactional roles, client financial profiles, customer risk assessments, historical risk patterns, and transactional patterns and exceptions. Each dataset plays a vital role in forming a comprehensive view of financial transactions and identifying potential money laundering activities. By merging these datasets, one can uncover complete patterns and anomalies.
